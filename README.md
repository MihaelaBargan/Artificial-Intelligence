# Artificial-Intelligence

The notebook contains the code for both the 2 exercises
Each cell in the notebook should be executed sequentially as there are certain dependencies on libraries and code performed in previous cells 
The training of the SGD models takes a bit longer than that of the GD (might take 1-2 minutes before you see the output) 

The GridSearch for the second exercise also takes a bit of time (2-3 minutes approximately)
